# True Commitment to Ethical Cybersecurity.

<details>
<summary>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE.</summary>

<br>


"Ladies and gentlemen, let me take a moment to talk about something crucial in today’s interconnected world: ethical cybersecurity. True commitment to ethical cybersecurity means using your skills, not for personal gain or recognition, but for the greater good. It’s about more than identifying vulnerabilities or neutralizing threats. It’s about acting decisively and compassionately to make a difference—to use your knowledge as a force for protecting, uplifting, and empowering others.

This commitment begins with recognizing that our role is not confined to our job descriptions or contracts. It’s about stepping up for those who need us most. Volunteering for projects that protect vulnerable populations, working with law enforcement to counter cybercriminals, and contributing to open-source security initiatives—these actions strengthen the very fabric of our digital ecosystem. In this world, we are more than professionals; we are protectors. We are stewards of trust and guardians of security, with a responsibility that extends far beyond personal or organizational boundaries.

Who are we protecting? Everyone. Cybercrime victims—whether individuals, small businesses, or massive corporations—are our neighbors. These are people who rely on our expertise and compassion, whether they know it or not. They deserve our help, regardless of their resources, status, or circumstances. It’s easy, perhaps, to prioritize high-profile clients or well-funded organizations, but true ethical commitment means treating every person’s security concerns with equal weight. No one is too small to matter. No security concern is too insignificant for our attention. Behind every breach, there’s a person—a life, a story, an impact.

Even when victims’ poor security practices make them vulnerable, our role isn’t to judge; it’s to offer solutions. Negligence may open doors for attackers, but it’s up to us to ensure those doors are closed, locked, and fortified for the future. This means educating users, not just blaming them; patching vulnerabilities, not just pointing them out; and always working toward better systems, not just better criticism. People make mistakes, and organizations sometimes fall behind. Our goal is not to admonish but to empower. The more we help people understand and implement strong security practices, the fewer opportunities exist for attackers.

Ethical cybersecurity also calls us to go beyond advocacy. We can’t simply preach best practices or advise others to adopt stronger measures—we must lead by example. Implement the solutions. Help users enable multi-factor authentication. Guide them step by step through the process of securing their networks and their lives. When we discover a vulnerability, it’s not enough to merely disclose it responsibly. Wherever possible, we must work to resolve it. Don’t just identify flaws—fix them. And don’t stop there; teach others to prevent those flaws from recurring. Be the catalyst for change, the bridge that closes the gap between insecurity and resilience.

This brings me to what I call the ‘Good Samaritan’ of cybersecurity. A Good Samaritan in our field is someone who uplifts and protects, even when it’s inconvenient, challenging, or thankless. They use their skills selflessly to safeguard others, demonstrating that the true mark of expertise isn’t in what we know, but in how we apply it for the betterment of all. They don’t discriminate based on who the victim is, how they came to be in their predicament, or what resources they bring to the table. They act because they can—and because they must. They recognize that cybersecurity is not just a technical field but a human one, built on trust, empathy, and the drive to create a safer world for everyone.

So, let us remember this: ethical cybersecurity isn’t about the glory of being the smartest in the room or the satisfaction of uncovering the flaws in a system. It’s about care, responsibility, and action. It’s about protecting the vulnerable, empowering the weak, and ensuring that every corner of our digital world is safe, secure, and inclusive. It’s about stepping out of our comfort zones and into the lives of others, understanding their challenges, and doing everything we can to help.

Let us strive to be the Good Samaritans of the digital space. Let us take responsibility not just for the systems we guard but for the people they serve. Cybersecurity isn’t just a job—it’s a calling. It’s a mission to make the world, both physical and digital, a safer place for everyone. And together, with compassion and dedication, we can build a future where security is not just a privilege but a universal standard. Thank you."

### Origins of GNU: A Visionary's Frustration:

* The seeds of GNU were sown in the fertile grounds of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in the early 1980s. It was here that Richard Stallman, a brilliant computer programmer and staunch advocate for software freedom, first encountered the shackles of proprietary software. Stallman's frustration with the limitations imposed by proprietary systems came to a head when he attempted to modify the software of a printer to address a recurring issue. Despite his efforts, he found himself thwarted by the proprietary nature of the software, which prevented him from accessing its source code.

  - This experience served as a catalyst for Stallman's awakening to the perils of closed, proprietary software. He recognized that such systems hindered users' freedom to study, modify, and share software—a stark departure from the collaborative ethos that had long defined the computing community. Determined to challenge this status quo, Stallman embarked on a mission to create a truly free and open-source operating system.

### The Birth of the GNU Project:

* In September 1983, Richard Stallman made a momentous declaration: the announcement of the GNU project. With unwavering resolve, Stallman outlined the project's objectives and philosophy in the seminal GNU Manifesto—a clarion call for the preservation of users' freedoms in the digital age. Recognizing the magnitude of the task at hand, Stallman resigned from MIT in 1984 to devote himself fully to the realization of his vision.

  - Central to Stallman's strategy was the establishment of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 1985. Serving as the beating heart of the GNU project, the FSF provided the essential support—both legal and financial—needed to advance the development of free software. Emphasizing the distinction between "free as in freedom" rather than "free as in price," Stallman and the FSF galvanized a community of like-minded individuals dedicated to the principles of software freedom.

### The GNU Ecosystem Takes Shape:

- As momentum grew behind the GNU project, a cadre of talented developers rallied to its cause. Together, they began crafting a suite of foundational software components essential for an operating system. Among the early milestones was the release of the GNU Emacs text editor in 1985, followed by the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) in 1987 and the GNU Debugger (GDB) in 1988. With each line of code, the vision of a free and open operating system drew closer to realization.

### The GNU General Public License: Safeguarding Freedom:

- A pivotal moment in the evolution of GNU came with the introduction of the GNU General Public License (GPL) in 1989. This ingenious legal framework, devised by Stallman, enshrined the rights of users and developers within the realm of free software. By ensuring that GPL-licensed software remained free and open for all to modify and redistribute, Stallman erected a bulwark against the encroachment of proprietary interests.

### Linux: The Missing Piece:

- In 1991, a Finnish computer science student named Linus Torvalds entered the fray with his creation: the Linux kernel. Inspired by a desire to overcome the limitations of existing operating systems, Torvalds unleashed Linux upon the world. While Linux initially operated under its own license, Torvalds later embraced the GPL, aligning his creation with the ethos of GNU.

### The Birth of GNU/Linux:

- With the convergence of the Linux kernel and the GNU ecosystem, a new era dawned. GNU/Linux, the amalgamation of these two seminal projects, emerged as a fully functional, free operating system. Combining the robustness of GNU's software suite with the flexibility of the Linux kernel, GNU/Linux rapidly gained traction, becoming the bedrock of countless devices and systems worldwide.

### Legacy of GNU: A Beacon of Freedom:

- Today, the spirit of GNU lives on, embodied in a global community of developers and users committed to the principles of freedom and collaboration. From its humble beginnings as a manifesto penned by a visionary programmer, GNU has blossomed into a movement that transcends boundaries and empowers individuals worldwide. As we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of technology, let us remember the legacy of GNU—a testament to the enduring power of openness, innovation, and the unyielding pursuit of freedom.

#### In conclusion, the making of GNU represents a pivotal chapter in the history of software development, showcasing the transformative potential of open-source principles. As we reflect on its journey, we are reminded of the profound impact that one individual's vision can have on the course of history. GNU stands not only as a triumph of technical ingenuity but also as a beacon of hope for a future where freedom and innovation flourish unhindered.
